<p>Given a list of career stats for a team of rugby players, 
    a list of player names, and a list of team names, in the format below:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
// players
{ 
    "players": [
        {
            "id": 112814,
            "matches": "123",
            "tries": "11"
        }
    ],
    "team": {
        "id": 10,
        "coach": "John Simmons"
    }
}
// names
{
    "names": [
        {
            "id": 112814,
            "name": "Greg Growden"
        }
    ]
}
// teams
{
    "teams": [
        {
            "id": 10,
            "team": "NSW Waratahs"
        }
    ]
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>Write a program that returns a 'team sheet' that lists
   the team, coach, players in that order in the following list format.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
[
    "Team Name, coached by CoachName",
    "1. PlayerName",
    "2. PlayerName"
    ....
]
</code>
</pre>
  
<p>
Where each element is a string, and the order of the players
is ordered by the number of matches played to the least matches played.
</p>

<p>For example, the following input should match the 
    following output exactly.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
// input data
{ 
    "players": [
        {"id": 1,"matches": "123", "tries": "11"},
        {"id": 2,"matches": "1",   "tries": "1"},
        {"id": 3,"matches": "2",   "tries": "5"}
    ],
    "team": {
        "id": 10,
        "coach": "John Simmons"
    }
}

{
    "names": [
        {"id": 1, "John Fake"},
        {"id": 2, "Jimmy Alsofake"},
        {"id": 3, "Jason Fakest"}
    ]
}

{
    "teams": [
        {"id": 10, "Greenbay Packers"},
    ]
}

// output
[
    "Greenbay Packers, coached by John Simmons",
    "1. John Fake",
    "2. Jason Fakest",
    "3. Jimmy Alsofake"
]
</code>
</pre>

<p>Your code must use the format below as a starting point:</p>

<pre>
<code>
// some sample data
const team  = require('./team.json');
const names = require('./names.json');
const teams = require('./teams.json');

function makeTeamList(team, names, teams) {
    // Take it step by step.
}

// do not change this line.
module.exports = makeTeamList;
</code>
</pre>
