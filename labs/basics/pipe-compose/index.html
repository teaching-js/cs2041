Write a program <b>pipe-compose.js</b> which returns two
functions; <b>pipe</b> and <b>compose</b>.

<p>
Pipe, should work much like the UNIX pipe. The output 
of the previous function should be piped into the next.
Pipe should be able to take in a list of functions and execute
them consecutively. You can expect valid input.
</p>

<p>
Compose, should work by 'wrapping' functions, the opposite direction to pipe.
The deepest call should happen first.
</p>

<p>To be clear; both functions need to return a function so that
    input can be passed in.
</p>

<p>Your starter code should look like this.</p>

<pre>
<code>

function pipe(...args) {}

function compose(...args) {}

module.exports = {
    pipe,
    compose
}
</code>
</pre>
